							<h2>Task</h2>
							
							<p>The task was to design something which is still undesigned or it's working badly. We had to think about apps, interfaces, devices of any everyday usage.</p>

							<h2>Decision</h2>
							
							<p>I decided to choose an ATM. For me this is most neglected device or interface in Poland. I never used an ATM with simplicity. There is always something which you are not sure of.</p>

							<h2>My project</h2>
							
							<p>So I designed interface of ATM. I made language choice available at all steps, so you can change language but by default it's local language. You can choose any amount by adding +10. Also there is no need to click "I don't want a receipt". You have several seconds to tap "Print receipt" button.</p>
